<h1>Chuck the vampire finch</h1>
<h3>He got his name after the death metal legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schuldiner">Chuck Schuldiner</a> (or is it the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1aG8QbhABVtVxNlAkk8VBW?si=NbfvWQhvRSWAOMkuIbcFkw">Sum-41 
album</a>? God knows...) I began working on him in early November 2022, his inital desgn was heavily based of some pidgeon oc i really liked from Furaffinity, not too proud of that one... I commissioned a good friend of mine, 
<a href="https://twitter.com/tobsybopsy">Toby</a> for the current ref, she finished it at about February 2023 and it's the most expensive commission I've bought up to date, she's done an amazing job of making him look more unique and cute, the wolf-shaped tail was also her 
idea and it looks really good, I would really recommend checking her out. The horns, one of his biggest stand points, are inspired by the Magic: The Gathering card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/snc/186/falco-spara-pactweaver
">Falco Spara, Pactweaver</a>, I just really liked the card ad thought it would make a cute lil' reference</h3>
