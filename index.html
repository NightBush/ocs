<h1>Chuck the vampire finch</h1>
<p>The second oc I've made got his name after the death metal legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schuldiner">Chuck Schuldiner</a> (or is it the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1aG8QbhABVtVxNlAkk8VBW?si=NbfvWQhvRSWAOMkuIbcFkw">Sum-41 
album</a>? God knows...) I began working on him in early November 2022. I don't draw him much mainly because the beak and the fluff on the head make him really difficult and frustrating to draw. I decided for a vampire finch because I 
sure knew this will be the first vampire finch oc in existance, rarely anyone even knows they're a thing. His inital design was heavily based of some pidgeon oc i really liked from Furaffinity, not too proud of that one... I commissioned 
a good friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobsybopsy">Toby</a> for the current ref, (when she asked how fluffy I want the head to be, I said "YES") she finished it at about February 2023 and it's the most expensive commission 
I've bought up to date, she's done an amazing job of making him look more unique and cute, the wolf-shaped tail was also her idea and it looks really good, I would really recommend checking her out. The horns, one of his biggest stand
points, are inspired by the Magic: The Gathering card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/snc/186/falco-spara-pactweaver">Falco Spara, Pactweaver</a>, I just really liked the card ad thought it would make a cute lil' reference. His outfit 
is typical 80's metal (although I kinda lost interest for that kind of clothing I still decided to keep it),apart from the fedora that's also a big part of making him unique, it's a flashback to my sister's ex boyfriend 
(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1fOg7K5giTKuWgIdczCYfB?si=9XdQ2F2ARWKrtsFjbLaFoA">he also has a band</a>) who really loved wearing one. A bit after Toby made the ref I wanted to tweak it a bit but the only change I could come 
up with is making the beak a bit sharper. I wanted to make him really tall because I'm pretty tall myself so I decided to include horns in his height making him stupidly tall, it's the furry fandom after all.</p> <br>
<p><h1>Lix the vernid</h1></p>
<p>I actually bought him as an adopt somewhere in March 2023, I somehow remember knowing vernids before I bought him but I have no idea where from, I just speculate it's <a href="https://twitter.com/LiLaiRa95">LiLaiRa</a>'s Twitter I 
randomly found one day. Anyhow, as crazy as it sounds, I found that adopt on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/604330/The_Crown_of_Leaves/">The Crown of Leaves</a>' <a href="https://discord.gg/nznYQbQGnX">Discord server</a> and 
I instantly fell in love with it (also because I was searching for an oc that would be "fursuitable" and easier to draw) and bought it the same day in fear someone else would get him before me. The price was 35 EUR which seemed weirdly 
high back then, but what I didn't know was that he's a royal vernid which is a closed species and costs 25 EUR on its own to "buy" so the whole adopt was technically only 10 EUR, a pretty big bargain in the end. His initial name was 
actually Peppermint which sounds absolutely disgusting so I decided to rename him into Lix, after a line from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/24UZFTvz8H88NwkFMKylV8?si=8445972d74854b56">Coroner's Host</a> 
("It winds slick/lix-like to have a fire site..."). I didn't change his design much, apart from making the tail longer, adding the mane patterns and the beard (which I might make longer in the future). In the beginning I was also 
getting weird feelings of guilt of how most vernids look better than him but after a while I calmed myself that that's really not the case. I have to give big thanks to a guy called matejm on Discord that HEAVILY helped me with his ref,
absolutely free of charge. I also shamelessly took the maw shot for the ref from the adopt base and I promise I'll change it soon. Another problem was with deciding about his height since male vernids are usually 5'10 and I'm 6'2 in 
real life and I would feel weird having an oc that's significantly shorter than me so I settled for 6'1 in the end which is still a pretty big difference.</hp>
