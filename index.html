<h1>Chuck the vampire finch</h1>
<h3>The second oc I've made got his name after the death metal legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schuldiner">Chuck Schuldiner</a> (or is it the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1aG8QbhABVtVxNlAkk8VBW?si=NbfvWQhvRSWAOMkuIbcFkw">Sum-41 
album</a>? God knows...) I began working on him in early November 2022. I don't draw him much mainly because the beak and the fluff on the head make him really difficult and frustrating to draw. I decided for a vampire finch because I 
sure knew this will be the first vampire finch oc in existance, rarely anyone even knows they're a thing. His inital design was heavily based of some pidgeon oc i really liked from Furaffinity, not too proud of that one... I commissioned 
a good friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobsybopsy">Toby</a> for the current ref, (when she asked how fluffy I want the head to be, I said "YES") she finished it at about February 2023 and it's the most expensive commission 
I've bought up to date, she's done an amazing job of making him look more unique and cute, the wolf-shaped tail was also her idea and it looks really good, I would really recommend checking her out. The horns, one of his biggest stand
points, are inspired by the Magic: The Gathering card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/snc/186/falco-spara-pactweaver">Falco Spara, Pactweaver</a>, I just really liked the card ad thought it would make a cute lil' reference. His outfit 
is typical 80's metal (although I kinda lost interest for that kind of clothing I still decided to keep it),apart from the fedora that's also a big part of making him unique, it's a flashback to my sister's ex boyfriend 
(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1fOg7K5giTKuWgIdczCYfB?si=9XdQ2F2ARWKrtsFjbLaFoA">he also has a band</a>) who really loved wearing one. A bit after Toby made the ref I wanted to tweak it a bit but the only change I could come 
up with is making the beak a bit sharper.</h3> <br>

I actually bought him as an adopt somewhere in March 2023, I somehow remember knowing vernids before I bought him but I have no idea where from, I just speculate it's
